        "Below is a demonstration of some useful techniques in building a traffic simulation. In Quiz 3 and Assignment 2, you will be asked to simulate the traffic in Berkeley using static and dynamic traffic assignments with given inputs. In this notebook, we will cover some background knowledge on how those inputs are generated. You don't need such knowledge to complete your quiz and assignment (though it would be helpful to look at the examples here). However, knowing these tools and techniques is helpful for you to build traffic simulations for other places, whenever there is such a need or interest.\n",

        "Data about the road network, such as the locations of intersections, the length, lanes, speed limit and geometry of a road link, is an integral part in traffic simulation. Thinking of traffic modeling as getting outcomes (e.g., traffic flow) under given road supply and travel demand, the road network then defines the supply of the system. The go-to place for finding such information is the OpenStreetMap (OSM), where you can find freely-available community-sourced road network data. Based on our experience, the data quality is very good for the US and may be a little unreliable (but still pretty useful) in other countries. Most countries also have official road network information provided to licensed users. If you can get the official information, the overall idea in how to process them for traffic analysis is still similar to what we will do below for OSM.\n",
