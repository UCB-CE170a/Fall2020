    "# Initial steps in building a traffic simulation: supply, demand data and shortest path calculation\n",
    "Below is a demonstration of some useful techniques in building a traffic simulation. In Quiz 3 and Assignment 2, you will be asked to simulate the traffic in Berkeley using static and dynamic traffic assignments with given inputs. In this notebook, we will cover some background knowledge on how those inputs are generated. You don't need such knowledge to complete your quiz and assignment (though it would be helpful to look at the examples here). However, knowing these tools and techniques is helpful for you to build traffic simulations for other places, whenever there is such a need or interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration tutorial is divided into three parts: (1) retrieving road network data; (2) establishing travel demands as trip origin-destinations (ODs); and (3) computing the shortest path between a given OD pair. Unlike previous exercises, there is no missing code below. \n",

    "### 1. Retrieving Road Network Data\n",
    "Data about the road network, such as the locations of intersections, the length, lanes, speed limit and geometry of a road link, is an integral part in traffic simulation. Thinking of traffic modeling as getting outcomes (e.g., traffic flow) under given road supply and travel demand, the road network then defines the supply of the system. The go-to place for finding such information is the OpenStreetMap (OSM), where you can find freely-available community-sourced road network data. Based on our experience, the data quality is very good for the US and may be a little unreliable (but still pretty useful) in other countries. Most countries also have official road network information provided to licensed users. If you can get the official information, the overall idea in how to process them for traffic analysis is still similar to what we will do below for OSM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show you three different ways to retrieve road network data from OSM. You can select the most convenient method depending on the scale of your problem.\n",

    "- Large datasets: Overpass API (shell commands)\n",

    "Overpass-turbo and Overpass introduced above can be used to download raw data from the OSM. It is useful if you want to make customized road network from the scratch. However, this is often not the case as cleaning the raw data can be a time consuming process. For example, in traffic simulations, we need the road network as a directed graph, which the OSM raw data is close to, but not exactly so. If you want to get a cleaned graph, you can use the excellent [OSMnx package](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/). It was developed by [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/) while he was a PhD student at UC Berkeley. The [original blog post](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/) and [code repo](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) provide clear instructions of how to use it. Here we will show how to retrieve the road network of North Berkeley, the one we will use for the homework of this module."

    "For traffic analysis, obtaining the travel demand data is among the most challenging tasks. Accurate travel demand inputs are indispensable in building a realistic model. However, we often cannot get such data due to resource or privacy constraints. There are several potential sources of travel demand data: regional or national travel surveys (conducted every 10 years or so, not reflecting short-term changes) and increasingly from commercial data providers that source anonymous and aggregated journey information using mobile phone signals. There are also travel-demand generation models based on land-use information.\n",

    "Route computation holds a special position in traffic model because it maps the travel demand to the network supply. A driver may take routes considering a variety of factors: time, monetary cost, safety, familiarity, emission, just to name a few. It is a common to assume drivers would take the fastest path, which is the shortest path on a road network graph weighted by the travel time (factoring in the distance as well as congestion status). Certainly in sophisticated models, the route choice criteria will be a lot more complex than purely the shortest path. However, we will use this simple assumption in this course.\n",

There are multiple [shortest-path finding algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem), while the [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is the most generally applicable one. In this class, we will use a specially developed shortest path code, [sp](https://github.com/cb-cities/sp), which implements priority-queue based Dijkstra's Algorithm and has been tested to run more efficiently than other packages.\n",

If your problem has special features, sometimes using other algorithm can give you even faster results. The [sp](https://github.com/cb-cities/sp) code is written in C++ with a Python wrapper. Normally you would need to compile the code on your computer. Here on colab, we provide a compiled dynamic library `liblsp.so`."
