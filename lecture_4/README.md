# Notebook for Lecture 4. Spatial data manipulation

## Objectives
* Constructing spatial features using [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) in Python.
* Calculating length of a LineString under different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS); coordinate transformation.
* Assigning household parcels to the closest road intersections using spatial index. The core idea behind the code is from [this blog](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/10/r-tree-spatial-index-python/). The code used to construct the Voronoi diagram is based on [this post](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/337561/making-polygon-for-every-point-in-set-using-voronois).
